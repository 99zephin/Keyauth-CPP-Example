# Keyauth-CPP-Example l By C0LL1DE

This is an example of intergrating https://keyauth.win/ API into a C++ Program.
This was originally inspired by the default C++ Example they provide on their github

### What's new :
- Fixed file managament {Code is in general more organised, seperate files for seperate category of functions}
- Added XorStr Function
- Added print output with colour {choose colour for your text, can be any colour you want in HEX}
- Added DLL Injection Security {Credits to ShadowMonster99}
- Added Hide Thread {Credits to Чихуахуа , Good for hiding against debuggers etc}
- Organised some functions {For example download file is now a function that takes 2 paramaters - FileID & FileOutputLocation}

### What may be to come :
- More protection for download files {Downloading files from a server and destroying download packets}
- More usermode protection {Checking for running debuggers, auto delete upon debugger etc}
- Improvements to general program efficiency
